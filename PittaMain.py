        Favor cooling foods: Incorporate foods that have a cooling effect on the body.
        Include sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes: Focus on foods with these tastes to balance excess heat.
        Limit spicy, oily, and acidic foods: Reduce or avoid foods that can increase Pitta, such as hot spices, fried foods, and excessive sourness.
        Stay hydrated: Drink cool or room temperature water and herbal teas to balance the heat.
        Enjoy fresh, ripe, and sweet fruits: Opt for sweet fruits like melons, grapes, and sweet berries.
        Sample No to Light Pitta Diet:
        - Breakfast: A bowl of cool oatmeal with ripe berries.
        - Lunch: Steamed vegetables with quinoa and a cooling mint-cucumber yogurt sauce.
        - Snack: Sliced watermelon or a cool cucumber salad.
        - Dinner: Basmati rice with steamed zucchini and a small serving of sweet and juicy fruits.

        "Moderate Pitha": '''
        Balanced meals: Include a mix of cooling and slightly warming foods to maintain equilibrium.
        Enjoy a variety of tastes: Incorporate sweet, bitter, astringent, and a moderate amount of pungent tastes.
        Moderation in spices: Use milder spices like coriander, fennel, and cardamom in your meals.
        Stay hydrated: Drink room temperature water and herbal teas.
        Include fresh and cooked foods: Combine raw and cooked vegetables, grains, and legumes.
        Sample Moderate Pitta Diet:
        - Breakfast: A fruit smoothie with ripe bananas, mangoes, and a pinch of cardamom.
        - Lunch: Mixed greens salad with roasted vegetables, quinoa, and a lemon-olive oil dressing.
        - Snack: Sliced apples with almond butter.

        High Pitta Dosha (>9):
        Emphasize cooling and calming foods: Prioritize foods with a strong cooling effect.
        Favor sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes: These tastes help balance excess heat and acidity.
        Avoid hot and spicy foods: Steer clear of very spicy, oily, and fried foods.
        Stay well-hydrated: Drink cool water, coconut water, and herbal teas.
        Include plenty of fresh fruits: Opt for sweet, juicy fruits that help cool the body.
